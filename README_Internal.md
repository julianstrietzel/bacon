1. Go to our [drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17I8rendHfYigHjjLoYC5rHL2ZfBiP4bC&usp=drive_fs) and Copy the
   folders to this base directory. They contain

- persistent logs where you should copy logs of runs that are relevant
- 3d_objects that might be relevant in their base form
- data sampled xyz files from objects for training
- resulted meshes from trained neural fields

-> Using these folders should always be with relevant namings!
Explicitly name the experiment used and special changes characterizing these runs.
